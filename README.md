# TromboneEventManager
A more convenient way to edit your .tmb files

## Features:
- Add or edit existing notes, lyrics and background events
- Import notes, lyrics and background events from other charts
- Edit the chart metadata
- Validate your chart by finding missing attributes and checking for note pitch, duration and overlaps
- Speed up adding or editing background data by automatically calculating the time in seconds

## Currently missing:
- The ability to delete notes, lyrics or events
- Changing the note colour (I couldn't figure out how to make a colour picker)
